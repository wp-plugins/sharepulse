SharePulse ranks in a widget your site's posts which have had the greatest social impact, using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and your comments.

== Description ==

Relying on hit counts simply does not reflect the impact of your posts. SharePulse finds and ranks your site's posts that have the greatest *social* impact. The stats are gathered from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn as well as your own site's most commented posts measuring actual engagement. SharePulse lets you display these posts in your site's sidebar showing off your posts which have had the greatest social impact over the past day, week, month year or for all time. Each post is displayed with the total number of tweets, shares and comments.

**Note:** This is the alpha for the plugin relaunch. Feedback is crucial, so please don't hesitate. We have a feature roadmap and [we want your input](http://sharepulse.net/contact/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where have you been? =

Earlier versions of SharePulse had relied on APIs that just weren’t reliable. It’s been rebuilt from the ground up to rely on the same tech that powers the share buttons. We’re hoping that this will be the magic sauce that keeps it working.

= I just Tweeted/Shared a post, why isn't it showing up? =

The short answer: SharePulse relies on the stats from different APIs (Application Programming Interface) they sometimes take a while to process the data.

= I would like to make a suggestion, how do I contact you? =

== Upgrade Notice ==

Version 2.0.2 unfortunately was DOA. The APIs that were relied upon were unreliable. After much research version 3 is working well. There’s a way to go for a full product. But this is a strong MVP.
